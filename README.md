# Ternary Search
- Ternary Search is a divide and conquer algorithm which runs in ***O(lg n)***.
- In fact it runs in ***Log3 n*** but in counting logarithmic wrost case we consider it as ***O(lg n)***.
- Ternary Search is extended version of Binary Search (it divides the array into 3 partintions) but it is less efficient (as it need 2 comparisons in the wrost case).
